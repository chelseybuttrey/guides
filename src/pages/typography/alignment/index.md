There are four basic alignements:
Flush left or left-aligned - text is aligned along the left margin or gutter
Flush right or right-aligned - text is aligned along the right margin or gutter
Justified - word-spacing the lettering are adjusted to fall flush with both margins
Centered - an even gap on both sides of the line
